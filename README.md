Bhejane Online Trading Store


1. Context
The Bhejane trading store is an online retailer specialising in Covid essential items. The store has recently been struggling with the management of its database-related inventory system. Luckily for them, you've been hired as a consultant to fix the problem.

Its time to flex your Ninja SQL skills!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

You will receive a denormalised database consisting of two tables. Your task is to transform the database such that is in third normal form (3NF). To ensure that a consistent normalisation process is followed by each student, we have attached an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which is a guideline on what tables need to be produced. Once you have normalised the database, you will be required to complete an MCQ test found under the 'Predict' tab of Athena.

Though the normalisation process, you will be guided into acknowledging client (Bhenjane Trading) use-cases for the database, and dealing with data anomalies in SQL.
